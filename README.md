# Retail Sales Analysis - My First Excel Data Project

## 🎯 What I Built
During Week 1 of the justIT Data Skills Bootcamp, I analyzed retail sales data to uncover customer trends and sales patterns. This was my introduction to using Excel for real data analysis!

## 💡 What I Learned
- **Excel Formulas**: Mastered absolute vs relative referencing (that `$` symbol finally clicked!)
- **Commission Calculations**: Built automated 1.5% commission tracking
- **Data Analysis**: Found that Electronics outsells other categories by £1,000+
- **Problem Solving**: Figured out why my commission formula wasn't copying correctly

## 🔍 Key Discoveries
- **Total Sales**: £456,000 across 1,000+ transactions
- **Best Category**: Electronics (£156,905)
- **Biggest Insight**: Customer age doesn't strongly predict purchase amount
- **Commission Generated**: £6,840 for 2023

## 🛠️ Excel Skills Used
- Advanced formulas (`SUMIF`, `IF`, `UNIQUE`)
- Absolute cell referencing (`=$M$3*I2`)
- Conditional formatting for visual insights
- Data validation and filtering
